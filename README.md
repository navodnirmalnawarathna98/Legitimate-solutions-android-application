# About The Project #

United Nations give us 17 sustainable development goals. 
There our group decided to get goal 16. that is peace justice and strong institutions. under this topic, there are some main targets to create action to promote peace justice and strong institutions.
1)	Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms.
2)	Promote the rule of law and ensure equal access to justice.
3)	Protect children from abuse exploitation trafficking and violence.
4)	Reduce violence everywhere
5)	Substantially reduce corruption and bribery.
<br/>

considering these facts, we thought of creating a mobile application to cover all the targets. our target audience is the Sri Lankans.
Nowadays Sri Lanka is in a very bad situation because of the Sri Lankan economic crisis. This affects people's lives in many ways. higher unemployment, reduced economic activity, reductions in income and wealth, and greater uncertainty about future jobs and income. as a result, most people's tendency to make Corruption, fraud, and theft has increased as also Violence, child abuse, trafficking, murder, and corruption are on the rise.
And most people had to face these bad things. But there are no guidelines here, if you have a problem, get reliable legal advice. Then we decided and considered all these things. If someone faces a problem, provide an opportunity to find a permanent legal solution through our application, ensuring the safety of that person.

This is the basic goal of our mobile application **“Provide an opportunity to find a permanent legal solution”** and we are doing this user research to identify what are the problem and which kind of solution for those problems.
To collect data related to stakeholders of the app and get made details about are they the environment that stakeholders are familiar with so that we can figure out what technical knowledge that users have and what kind of web experience they are confident in and fine-tune the problems and matters they face in real life scenarios on peace, justice, and strong institutions.
to understand the life of the Sri Lankan lawyer and get more understanding about their day-to-day life and daily routine. and, a clear understanding of the process of getting connected with their clients and examining their satisfaction with the current process in order to the feature of attracting and getting more clients easy and effective via the app to be developed. And get the details of the most used mobile applications and how they feel about those apps and how they use those apps and how they use those apps to get success of their correct life. So that we could be able to design and give them a more familiar and attractive UI and UE in the app.
